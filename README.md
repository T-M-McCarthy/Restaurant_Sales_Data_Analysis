Restaurant Sales Data Analysis:

This project involves analyzing restaurant sales data from the fast_food_sales table. The SQL queries used in this project cover a range of operations that help clean the data, perform aggregations, and generate business insights.

1. View the Sales Data and Check for Missing Values
This step checks the integrity of the data by viewing the full dataset and identifying any missing values, particularly in the item price column. This is crucial for understanding data completeness.

2. Handle Missing Data
In this step, we update the dataset to replace any empty or missing transaction type values with a default value ('Unknown'). This ensures consistency in the data and avoids errors during analysis.

3. Data Cleaning and Date Format Update
This section updates the date format in the fast_food_sales table so that all dates follow the same format (YYYY-MM-DD). This ensures consistency in the dataset for further analysis.

4. Earliest and Latest Date of Sale
This query identifies the earliest and latest dates of sale in the dataset. It provides an understanding of the sales period covered by the data.

5. List of Items on the Menu
This query retrieves all distinct items from the menu to help identify the variety of food offerings. It gives an overview of the restaurant’s menu.

6. Identify the Least and Most Expensive Items
These queries find the least and most expensive items from the menu by identifying the minimum and maximum item prices. This allows the restaurant to understand pricing trends.

7. Item Types Available
This query identifies the different categories or types of items offered by the restaurant, such as drinks, snacks, or main dishes. Understanding item types helps analyze product categories and trends.

8. Quantity of Items Sold by Type
This query aggregates the quantity of items sold per item type, which helps identify the popularity of different categories of items.

9. Total Revenue by Item Type
This query calculates the total revenue generated by each item type. It gives insight into which categories of items contribute most to the restaurant’s revenue.

10. Sales by Time of Day
This query analyzes the number of sales transactions by different times of the day. It helps identify peak sales times, which can be useful for staffing and inventory management.

11. Number of Transactions by Transaction Type
This query counts the number of transactions for each transaction type (e.g., dine-in, take-out). It helps the restaurant understand how sales are split between different transaction methods.

12. Total Revenue Across All Items
This query calculates the total revenue generated across all item types. It includes both category-wise revenue and the overall revenue, giving a comprehensive view of the restaurant's financial performance.


Conclusion
This set of SQL queries demonstrates fundamental data analysis techniques, including:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing or incomplete data.
Aggregation: Summing data to calculate total revenue, quantities sold, etc.
Grouping: Grouping data by categories such as item type or transaction type.
Sorting: Ordering data based on specific criteria like price or sales volume.

These queries provide valuable insights into restaurant sales data, helping to make informed business decisions such as pricing strategies, inventory management, and marketing.
